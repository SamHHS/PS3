                <h2>Case description</h2>
                <p>The kwartje case has been a assignment for school as well, it was used to create a website where a brewery is able to show of their products and invite the visitors to become customers.  This was also a solo project so everything that has been done such as designing the website and developing the website has all been part of a solo project.</p>

            <h2>Sketches</h2>
            <p>The first part of the process is sketching out possible idea's for the website. This can be done on paper or digitaly, in this case its been done on paper at first and transitioned into digital later on in the process.</p>

            <h2>Wireframe</h2>
            <p>Wireframes are an important part of the process, this is the first time youll actually see the shapes and layout of the website you are designing. This leaves enough time and space for improvement which is a big part of this step. </p>

            <h2>HiFi prototype</h2>
            <p>The HiFi prototype is a great tool when designing a website or application. The HiFi prototype will give a good insight in the style of the website and the overall look at the end. Therefore it plays a major part when desining a website.</p>

            <h2>Mockup</h2>
            <p>Here is an example of the website in a working state. This shows the end result of the project which in my opinion adds a lot to the bigger picture of a rehaul of the website.</p>
